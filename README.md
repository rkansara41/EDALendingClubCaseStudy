<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Through this Case Study, we aimed to understand the factors that lead to loan defaults for different types of customers. Furthermore, we can roughly conclude which audience to target for giving loans on the basis of their repayment capabilities. Following is the rough criteria for loan defaults:
    1) Annual Income
    2) Interest Rate
    3) Employment Length
    4) Loan Amount
    5) State
    6) Grade
    7) Public Bankruptcies Record
    8) Purpose
